This repository demonstrates a common error in TypeScript where the forEach loop continues to iterate even after an error has occurred. The original code attempts to parse string elements into numbers. If a non-numeric string is encountered, an error message is printed, but the loop continues, potentially leading to unexpected behavior. The solution adds a return statement within the forEach callback to gracefully handle invalid inputs and prevent further processing after encountering an error.
